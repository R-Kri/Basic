### The Need for JavaScript
In the early 1990s, the World Wide Web was rapidly gaining popularity. Websites at the time were primarily static, meaning they could only display fixed content without any user interaction beyond simple hyperlinks. There was a growing need for a way to make websites more dynamic and interactive to enhance the user experience. This necessity gave rise to the concept of a scripting language that could run within web browsers to manipulate web page content, validate user inputs, and create more engaging web applications.

JAVASCRIPT IS A SYNCHRONOUS SINGLE THREADED LANGUAGE.
